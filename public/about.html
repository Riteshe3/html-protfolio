<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a Bachelor of Commerce student with a passion for computers. I have always been fascinated by how computers work and how they power the technology that we use every day. This curiosity led me to explore the world of web development, where I started learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, I soon realized that to truly excel in this field, I needed to develop a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms.

  With this goal in mind, I embarked on a journey to learn Java, a powerful and versatile programming language. While Java may be a bit more challenging than other languages, I am determined to master its syntax and logic. I am also eager to learn more about networking, particularly how the internet works and how various technologies bring it to our homes through Wi-Fi.
